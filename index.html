            <h2> Little Bit About Kris</h2>
            <!-- <img  src="./Images/Website profilepic.png" alt="Female sitting in a chair dressed in beige">
            <p class="move-left">Hiya, my name is Kristyn but I go by Kris. I have had one spectacular journey to get here. I got my
                Bachelors in Integrative Physiology at CU Boulder. There I had some amazing experiences such as dissecting cadavers
                and leading medical trips abroad. I also worked in the medical industry for the past 2 years. Life has taken me now to the realm of tech and I look forward to using the
                experiences I have to better prepare me for this next challenge</p> -->

            <!-- <p class="move-right">As you can see I have a best friend. Her name is Minnie Mouse, and yet I never particularly fangirled over Disney. What can you do when your dog just looks like a perfect mouse? I feel so grateful to have amazing people and an amazing pooch by my side no matter what. I hope you can see why my passion is still going strong.</p> -->
            <p >HIYA! My name is Kristyn but I go by Kris. I am a full stack web developer leveraging a Bachelors from the University of Colorado-Boulder with a medical and
            customer-oriented background to build the best user experience on the web. Certificate from the University of Denver in
            full stack web development, with newly developed skills in JavaScript, Express, Jest, Node, React, MERN & SERN stack,
            restful APIs and GraphQL. Skilled in meeting deadlines and learning quickly and efficiently. Passionate about
            approaching programming challenges from different angles and collaborating with team members to create the best web
            application experience for both the user and the client. I applied aspects of UX and agile development in a recent
            project along with creating an API and working with GraphQL and React. I worked on a team of five to develop a
            multi-page MERN app that allows for users to log in and see coding events, helpful resources, a forum page, as well as
            an instant messaging function to communicate with all users on the platform. I‚Äôm excited to leverage my skills as part
            of a fast-paced, quality-driven team to build better experiences on the web. I have a passion for back end development
            but I feel comfortable working whatever part of the application front or back that is in need! </p>
