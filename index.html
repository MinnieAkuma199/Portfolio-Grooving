            <img  src="./Images/Website profilepic.png" alt="Female sitting in a chair dressed in beige">
            <p class="move-left">Hiya, my name is Kristyn but I go by Kris. I have had one spectacular journey to get here. I got my
                Bachelors in Integrative Physiology at CU Boulder. There I had some amazing experiences such as dissecting cadavers
                and leading medical trips abroad. Life has taken me now to the realm of tech and I look forward to using the
                experiences I have to better prepare me for this next challenge</p>
            <img src="./Images/Minniepic.png" alt="Young female with small dog in lap and foliage all around">
            <p class="move-right">As you can see I have a best friend. Her name is Minnie Mouse, and yet I never particularly fangirled over Disney. What can you do when your dog just looks like a perfect mouse? I feel so grateful to have amazing people and an amazing pooch by my side no matter what. I hope you can see why my passion is still going strong.</p>
