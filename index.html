            <p>Hiya, my name is Kristyn but I go by Kris. I have had one spectacular journey to get here. I got my bachelors in Integrative Physiology at CU Boulder. Here I had some amazing experiences such as dissecting cadavers and leading medical trips abroad.</p>

            <p>As you can see I have a best friend. Her name is Minnie Mouse, and yet I never thought I particularly fangirled over Disney. What can you do when your dog just looks like a perfect mouse? I feel so grateful to have amazing people and an amazing pooch by my side no matter what.</p>
