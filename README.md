# Portfolio-Grooving

[Deployed Portfolio](https://minnieakuma199.github.io/Portfolio-Grooving/)

## Description

The purpose of this was to provide a location where potential employers can get to know me, view the work I have done, and to have the ability to contact me.
I did not have a location where I could link everything about me both proffessionally and personally. This website will continue to evolve as I learn more.

## Design

You can find an example of my original mockup before I started programming the website below. As you can see it has changed slightly as I improve and gain more knowledge, my designs alter too. My goal is to be user-friendly while showcasing my skills.
